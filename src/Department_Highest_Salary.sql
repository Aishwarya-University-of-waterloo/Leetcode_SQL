-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It is guaranteed that department name is not NULL.
-- Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
-- Write a solution to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- TABLE SCHEMA:
Create table If Not Exists Employee (id int, name varchar(255), salary int, departmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (id int, name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '1')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('2', 'Jim', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('3', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('4', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('5', 'Max', '90000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (id, name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (id, name) values ('2', 'Sales')

-- SOLUTION:
WITH cte AS
    (SELECT
        departmentid,
        name as employee,
        salary,
        dense_rank()over(partition by departmentid order by salary desc) as rk
    FROM employee)

SELECT
    d.name as department,
    employee,
    salary
FROM cte
JOIN department d
    ON d.id = cte.departmentid
    WHERE rk=1
