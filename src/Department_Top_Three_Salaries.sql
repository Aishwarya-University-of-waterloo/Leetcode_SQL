-- A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

-- Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.
-- Return the result table in any order.


-- TABLE SCHEMA:
Create table If Not Exists Employee (id int, name varchar(255), salary int, departmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (id int, name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('5', 'Janet', '69000', '1')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('6', 'Randy', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) values ('7', 'Will', '70000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (id, name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (id, name) values ('2', 'Sales')

-- SOLUTION:
SELECT
    t1.Department,
    t1.employee,
    t1.salary
FROM (  SELECT
            d.name as Department,
            e.name as employee,
            e.salary,
            dense_rank()over(partition by e.departmentID order by e.salary desc) as salary_rank
        FROM employee as e
        INNER JOIN department as d
            ON e.departmentID=d.id) as t1
        WHERE salary_rank <4
